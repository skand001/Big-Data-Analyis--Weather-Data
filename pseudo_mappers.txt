Start

Read each line from standard input

For each line do:
    Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the line
    Split the line into fields separated by commas
    
    Check if there are at least 21 fields
    If so, proceed to the next step
    Otherwise, skip the rest of the steps and read the next line
    
    Assign the second field to 'date'
    Assign the thirteenth field to 'wind_speed'
    Assign the twelfth field to 'relative_humidity'
    Assign the ninth field to 'dry_bulb_temp'
    Assign the tenth field to 'dew_point_temp'
    
    If 'wind_speed', 'relative_humidity', 'dry_bulb_temp', and 'dew_point_temp' are not empty
        Output 'date', 'wind_speed', 'relative_humidity', 'dry_bulb_temp', 'dew_point_temp' separated by tabs
