Initialize logging to record processing errors in 'processing_errors.log'

Define function 'mean' that calculates the average of a list of numbers
Define function 'variance' that calculates the variance of a list of numbers given the mean
Define function 'pearson_correlation' that calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between two lists

Initialize 'current_date' to None
Initialize lists for 'wind_speeds', 'relative_humidities', 'dry_bulb_temps', and 'dew_point_temps'

For each line read from standard input:
    Strip the line of whitespace and split it by tab into date, wind_speed, relative_humidity, dry_bulb_temp, dew_point_temp
    
    Try to convert wind_speed to float, log any conversion errors and use default value 0.0
    Try to convert relative_humidity to float, log any conversion errors and use default value 0.0
    Try to convert dry_bulb_temp to float, log any conversion errors and use default value 0.0
    Try to convert dew_point_temp to float, log any conversion errors and use default value 0.0
    
    If 'current_date' is the same as 'date' from the input:
        Append all converted values to their respective lists
    Else:
        If 'current_date' is not None:
            Calculate max and min wind speed, min relative humidity
            Calculate mean and variance of dew point temperatures
            Calculate Pearson correlation for relative humidity and wind speed, relative humidity and dry bulb temp, wind speed and dry bulb temp
            
            Print formatted results including date, wind speed range, min relative humidity, dew point mean, variance, and the three correlations
        
        Set 'current_date' to 'date' from the input
        Set the measurement lists to include the current line's values

If 'current_date' is not None after finishing input processing:
    Repeat the calculation and printing steps for the last date
